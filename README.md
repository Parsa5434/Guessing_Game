# Guessing_Game
a very simple guessing game , try it for your self !
to run the game you must have python 3.01.2 or newer 
to download the python interpreter go to : https://www.python.org/downloads/
i would love if someone wanted to right another game with me or make some changes to the code to make it better




the newer version is so much better than the old one try the upgraded version instead
have fun!
